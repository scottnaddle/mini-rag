# Mini-RAG: Local AI Cowork Platform

**English** | **[한국어](README.ko.md)**

---

A local-first AI platform that turns your documents into an intelligent workspace. Upload Excel, PDF, DOCX, or PPTX files, ask questions in any language, generate new documents, and get career analysis — all powered by 11 specialized AI agents working together.

## Why Mini-RAG?

Most RAG systems stop at "upload a PDF and ask questions." Mini-RAG goes further:

- **Structured data understanding** — Upload an Excel with employee records, and ask "Who in the engineering team has Python experience?" The system preserves row/column relationships, not just text.
- **Document generation** — Ask "Create a financial report based on our data" and get a real `.docx` file, not just a chat response.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — 11 specialized agents (education, HR, finance, etc.) each with domain-specific skills, automatically selected based on your question.
- **Career intelligence** — Upload education/certification data and get competency analysis, skill gap reports, and future job recommendations.
- **Multilingual** — Ask in Korean, English, Japanese, **Sinhala (සිංහල)**, or **Tamil (தமிழ்)**. The system auto-detects the script and expands queries across languages.

## What Can You Do?

### 1. Ask questions about your documents

Upload any document and ask questions. The system searches using hybrid FTS5 + vector search and cites sources.

AI: ## 재무회계란?
    재무회계는 기업 외부정보이용자를 대상으로 하는 회계입니다. [testfile.pdf p.3]
    ...
```

### 2. Query structured Excel data

Upload an Excel file with employee data, project lists, or any tabular data. Ask specific questions about rows and columns.

```

```

### 4. Generate documents

Ask the AI to create reports, presentations, or spreadsheets based on your indexed data.

```

### How Search Works

1. **Document Upload** → parsed by format (PDF pages, Excel rows, Markdown headings)
2. **Excel Special Treatment** → headers preserved in every chunk as markdown tables
3. **FTS5 Indexing** → immediate, Korean phrase matching optimized
4. **Vector Embedding** → background async (paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2, 384 dim, 50+ languages)
5. **Query Time**:
   - Server pre-searches with full message + individual keywords + multilingual expansion
   - Unicode script detection: Sinhala, Tamil, Korean, English, Japanese
   - Results injected into LLM prompt before agent execution
   - Agent can call `search_documents` for additional searches

### How Agent Routing Works

1. **Keyword Matching** → `skill-router.ts` scores agents by keyword hits
2. **Multilingual Expansion** → English "education" → Korean "교육" → Sinhala "අධ්‍යාපනය" / Tamil "கல்வி" for matching
3. **Dynamic Skill Loading** → only matched agents get their Skills loaded (saves tokens)
4. **LLM Orchestration** → Claude decides which agent to delegate to
5. **Pre-Search Injection** → search results included in prompt regardless of agent choice

## 76 Skills

Skills are markdown frameworks embedded into agent prompts at runtime. They give each agent domain expertise.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 20+ | Server runtime |
| **npm** | 10+ | Package management |
| **Python** | 3.10+ | Document generation (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) |
| **Anthropic API Key** | — | LLM (Claude Haiku 4.5) |

### Step 1: Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raondaon-kim/mini-rag.git
cd mini-rag

# Server dependencies
npm install

# Client dependencies
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### Step 2: Python Libraries (for document generation)

```bash
pip install python-pptx openpyxl xlsxwriter python-docx reportlab Pillow
```

These are required for the AI to generate `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, and `.pdf` files.
The server checks for these at startup and will warn if any are missing.

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
# Required — get from https://console.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here

# Server port (default: 4001)
PORT=4001

# Document folder (auto-indexed on startup)
DOCS_PATH=./docs

# Data folder (SQLite DB, generated files)
DATA_PATH=./data
DB_PATH=./data/rag.sqlite
```

> **Note:** The vector embedding model (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`, 384dim) is downloaded automatically on first run (~80MB). No OpenAI key needed — embedding runs locally and supports 50+ languages including Sinhala and Tamil.

### Step 4: Run

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend (port 4001)
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start frontend dev server (port 5173)
npm run dev:client
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

### Step 5: Upload Documents

- **Drag & drop** files onto the browser window
- Or place files in the `docs/` folder (auto-indexed on server start)
- **Supported formats:** `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.md`, `.txt`, and 20+ code file types

### Production Build (Single Server)

```bash
npm run build:start   # Builds frontend + starts integrated server on port 4001
```

This serves both API and frontend from a single Express server.

### First-Time Checklist

After starting:
1. Upload an Excel file (e.g., employee data, education records)
2. Try: "Tell me about [person name]" or "Who works in [department]?"
3. Try: "Create a report about [topic]"
4. Check the sidebar for generated files and conversation history

## Key Design Decisions

- **FTS5 > Vector for Korean** — paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 supports 50+ languages but FTS5 still leads for Korean, so FTS5 gets higher weight (1.5 vs 1.0)
- **Multilingual embedding** — replaced English-only all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 for Sinhala/Tamil/Korean/Japanese/English cross-language search
- **Server-side pre-search** — LLM sometimes skips calling search tools, so we always inject search results into the prompt
- **Excel as markdown tables** — ExcelJS parses sheets into header+row markdown, with headers repeated per chunk for searchability
- **Dynamic skill loading** — only matched agents load their skills (~5K tokens vs 22K), saving cost per query
- **Background vector embedding** — FTS5 indexed immediately for fast search, vectors generated async
